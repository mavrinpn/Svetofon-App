# About

Svetofon is a mobile native application developed with a fully custom design for iOS using Swift language.

The application allows the user to control multiple Capsula air purifiers. It uses the BLE 4.0 protocol to communicate with the devices. The app provides complete two-way communication with the device: reading current readings, managing operation modes, setting the device's schedule, adjusting parameters, and displaying errors.

A hidden engineering menu is implemented specifically for the manufacturer, allowing initial device setup and testing.

The mobile application is designed to support connecting new models of air purifiers in the future.
